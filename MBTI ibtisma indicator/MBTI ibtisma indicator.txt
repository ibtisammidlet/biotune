farther analysis
between Intuitive and Observant seems Observant have more self control, more fucos intently none adhd
but Intuitive is global life analyser, his life look (in thought stream) all past present and futur like i does, which make him less capable for tasks need focus, and less capable for what happen rightnow, PFC resource shared.

generally as of exprience i gained on my life being baseline Intuitive and superhuman being multiple months in my life, i would surely indicat that Observant is better

N=unk                              S=unk        
T=D2+ 	                           F=d2-			
J=D3-/D4-                          P=D3+/D4+
