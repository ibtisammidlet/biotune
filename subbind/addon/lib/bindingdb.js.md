# clearer substance binding for biohackers  

bindingdb.org is a meta search engine that fetch data from other search engine like PSPP,  
i tried to find a easy way to know the median binding of a substance using bindingdb.org but the data was hard to use , so i developed a addon that will scrap the data and give you easy way to know the median binding of any substance  

## how to use:
-select a substance name from any site (eg, wikipedia) then right click and choose "find binding for ****"  
-or click addon icon for specific name search  

## added features to bindingdb.org:
-table sorting  
-automatically detect agonist/antagonist  
-convert scientific numbers to normal  
-remove additions text keep nM  
-setting efficacy  
-delete non human study if human study is available for specific receptor  
-add efficacy in ki from IC/EC50  
-deleting other value if ki available  
- fetch all data instead of 50 everytime  
-give alert when data was not fully loaded  

## aiming:  
auto selectivity calculation
